# <img src="/images/thiefmd_128.png" style="float: left; height: 1em; width: 1em;" /> ThiefMD, the Markdown Editor worth stealing

Based on Open Source Technologies, ThiefMD is a Markdown editor and file manager inspired by [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app). ThiefMD is based on open source code from [Quilter](https://github.com/lainsce/quilter) and [other projects](/about#credit).

Static Site Generators? Novel Writing? Book reports? ThiefMD loves handling all your markdown files and compiling them to whatever format you need. [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) runs under the hood, so if you can dream it, ThiefMD can build it.

Manage your <span class="pun">\*\*mark\*\*</span> without any <span class="ny">\-down\-</span>sides. Your library is your file system. Sync using any service you choose[^no-file-sync]. Even use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to have a file history[^no-git].

[^no-file-sync]: ThiefMD has no sync support built in.
[^no-git]: ThiefMD has no built in Git support.

See what your work looks like in real time. Is that your battery draining? Yes, and the Markdown it's powering never looked so good.

A separate window allows for focusing on your writing or reading. From [blogging](/tips/jekyll) to [novel writing](/tips/novel-writing), ThiefMD helps your words look good 😎
