ThiefMD is a [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) & [Fountain](https://fountain.io) editor that helps with `organization and management`. It is heavily inspired by [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app). Initial code was based on work from [Quilter](https://github.com/lainsce/quilter).

## Building

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kmwallio/ThiefMD.git
$ cd ThiefMD
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update --remote --recursive
$ meson build && cd build
$ ninja
$ sudo ninja install
```

[Prebuilt packages](https://github.com/kmwallio/ThiefMD/releases) are available.

### Building and Running the Tests

By default the code is built without tests. To compile the test suite the project has to be told to do so by setting the meson variable `build_tests`.

After that they can be built and run by `ninja`:

```bash
$ meson configure -Dbuild_tests=true build
$ cd build && ninja && ninja tests
```
